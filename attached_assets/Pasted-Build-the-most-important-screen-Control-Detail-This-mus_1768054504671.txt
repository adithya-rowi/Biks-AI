Build the most important screen: Control Detail. This must feel like an auditor's workspace, not a task manager.

ROUTE: /assessments/:id/controls/:control_id

NON-NEGOTIABLES:
- CIS Controls IG1 only
- Deterministic scoring: score computed from criteria (met/partial/not_met). AI never sets final status.
- Every criterion shows audit citation: document + version + page + section. No vague "View" links.
- Reviewer can override at criterion level with required reason + logged change.
- Locking freezes edits and shows "Locked" banner with who/when.

LAYOUT:
- Two-column on desktop (left: audit content, right: workflow)
- Single column on mobile
- Match existing app styling

HEADER:
- Breadcrumb: Assessments > CIS IG1 Assessment - January 2025 > Control 1.1
- Title: "1.1 — Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory"
- Status badge: Covered (green) / Partial (amber) / Gap (red)
- Score: "60%" + "3 of 5 criteria met"
- Metadata: Last assessed, Reviewer, Document count
